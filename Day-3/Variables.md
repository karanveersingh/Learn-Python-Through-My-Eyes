# Varaiables in Python
In Python, variables are used as named containers for storing data values. They allow for the storage and manipulation of information within a program.

**Key characteristics of Python variables:**  

**Assignment:**  

- Variables are created by assigning a value to a name using the assignment operator =. For example, age = 30  - creates a variable named age and assigns it the integer value 30.  

**Dynamic Typing:**  

- Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require explicit declaration of a variable's data type. The type is automatically inferred based on the assigned value. A variable can also be reassigned a value of a different type during program execution.   

**Referencing Memory Locations:**    

A variable name acts as a reference or pointer to a specific memory location where the actual data value is stored.  

**Rules for Naming:**  
- Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).  
- They cannot start with a number.  
- They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.  
- They are case-sensitive (e.g., Age and age are considered different variables).  
- Reserved keywords (like if, for, while) cannot be used as variable names.  

**Examples**  
- Assigning an integer value to a variable  
number = 10  

- Assigning a string value to a variable  
name = "Alice"  

- Assigning a boolean value to a variable  
is_active = True 

- Printing the values of the variables  
print(number)  
print(name)  
print(is_active)
