# Keywords in Python  

Keywords in Python are reserved words that hold special meanings and purposes within the language.  
They are fundamental building blocks that define Python's syntax and structure.  
Keywords cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names, class names) because they are reserved for specific functionalities within the Python interpreter.  

**Examples of Python keywords include:**    
- False, True, None: Represent boolean values and the absence of a value.  

- and, or, not: Logical operators.  

- if, elif, else: Used for conditional statements.  

- for, while, break, continue: Used for loops and loop control.  

- def: Used to define functions.  

- class: Used to define classes.  

- import, from, as: Used for importing modules and aliasing.  

- try, except, finally, raise: Used for exception handling.  

- return: Used to return a value from a function.  

- with, as: Used for context management.  

- lambda: Used to create anonymous functions.  

- global, nonlocal: Used to manage variable scope.  

- assert: Used for debugging and making assertions.  

- del: Used to delete objects.  

- pass: A null operation; used as a placeholder.  

- await, async: Used for asynchronous programming (introduced in Python 3.7).  

The exact number of keywords can vary slightly between Python versions, but they consistently serve as the core elements of the language's grammar. Attempting to use a keyword as an identifier will result in a SyntaxError.
