## Functions and modules are both fundamental concepts for organizing and reusing code, but they serve different purposes and operate at different levels of granularity.  

**Function:**  
A function is a self-contained block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. It encapsulates a sequence of instructions, potentially taking input parameters and returning an output value. 
Functions are defined using the def keyword and are called by their name, often with arguments passed within parentheses

**Practical:**  
def greet(name):  
    """This function greets the given name."""  
    return f"Hello, {name}!"  

message = greet("Karan")  
print(message)  

NOTE: In this example, greet is a function that takes a name argument and returns a greeting message.

**Module:**
A module is a file containing Python code, which can include definitions of functions, classes, variables, and runnable statements.  
Modules serve as a way to logically organize related code and promote reusability across different programs or parts of a larger project.   
Modules are imported using the import statement, allowing access to their contents.  

Practical - 
- my_module.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

- main_script.py
import my_module  

result = my_module.add(5, 3)
print(result)  

obj = my_module.MyClass(10)
print(obj.value)  

**Scope and Granularity:**  
A function is a smaller, more specific unit of code that performs a single task, while a module is a larger container that can hold multiple functions, classes, and variables, organizing them into a logical unit.  

**Purpose:**  
- Functions are used to encapsulate specific operations for reusability within a program.   
- Modules are used to organize and share collections of related code across different programs or larger projects.  

**Usage:**  
Functions are called by their name, while modules are imported to make their contents accessible.  

**File Structure:**  
Functions are defined within Python files (which can be modules), while modules are the Python files themselves.
