## In Python, both command-line arguments and environment variables provide mechanisms for passing information to a script, but they serve different purposes and are accessed differently.  

**Command-Line Arguments:**
Command-line arguments are values passed to a script directly when it is executed from the command line. They are typically used for specific, immediate inputs required for the script's execution, such as filenames, numerical parameters, or flags controlling behavior. 

- Accessing: Command-line arguments are accessed through the sys.argv list, which is part of the built-in sys module.
    - sys.argv[0] contains the name of the Python script itself.
    - sys.argv[1:] contains a list of the actual arguments passed.

**Environment Variables:**  
Environment variables are global variables that are set at the operating system level and are accessible by any process running within that environment. They are typically used for configuration settings that persist across multiple script executions or for sensitive information like API keys.

- Accessing: Environment variables are accessed through the os.environ dictionary, which is part of the built-in os module.

- Setting (within Python): You can also set environment variables within a Python script, though these changes typically only affect the current process and its child processes, not the global system environment.    

NOTE - To make MY_API_KEY available before running the script (on Linux/macOS): export MY_API_KEY="your_secret_key"

**Key Differences:**
**Scope:**
- Command-line arguments are specific to a single script execution, while environment variables have a broader, system-wide or process-wide scope.

- Persistence:
Environment variables can be set to persist across sessions (depending on how they are set), whereas command-line arguments are ephemeral.

- Purpose:
Arguments are for immediate input, while environment variables are for configuration and sensitive data.
