# Identity Operator Example in Python

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

# 'is' checks if both variables point to the same object
print(a is b)   # True, because b is assigned to a
print(a is c)   # False, because c is a different object with the same content

# 'is not' checks if both variables do not point to the same object
print(a is not c)  # True

# For comparison of values, use '=='
print(a == c)   # True, because their contents are equal
