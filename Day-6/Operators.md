## Opertors in Python
Python provides several types of operators that allow you to perform operations on variables and values. Here are the main categories:

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for mathematical operations:
- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `%` Modulus
- `**` Exponentiation
- `//` Floor division

### 2. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables:
- `=` Assign
- `+=` Add and assign
- `-=` Subtract and assign
- `*=` Multiply and assign
- `/=` Divide and assign
- `%=` Modulus and assign
- `**=` Exponentiate and assign
- `//=` Floor divide and assign

### 3. Comparison Operators
Used to compare values:
- `==` Equal to
- `!=` Not equal to
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
- `<=` Less than or equal to

### 4. Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements:
- `and` Returns True if both statements are true
- `or` Returns True if one of the statements is true
- `not` Reverses the result

### 5. Bitwise Operators
Operate on binary numbers:
- `&` AND
- `|` OR
- `^` XOR
- `~` NOT
- `<<` Left shift
- `>>` Right shift

### 6. Membership Operators
Test for membership in a sequence:
- `in`
- `not in`

### 7. Identity Operators
Compare memory locations:
- `is`
- `is not`

**Example:**
```python
a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)      # 15
print(a > b)      # True
print(a and b)    # 5 (since both are non-zero)
print(a is b)     # False
