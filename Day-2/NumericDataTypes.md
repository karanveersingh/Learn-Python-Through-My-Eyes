## Numeric Data Types in Python  
Python has several built-in numeric data types:  

1. Integers
Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.  
Example: x = 5, y = -3  

2. Floats  
Numbers that contain a decimal point.  
Example: a = 3.14, b = -0.001 

3. Complex Numbers  
Numbers that have a real and an imaginary part.  
Example: c = 2 + 3j, where j is the imaginary unit.  

**Type Conversion**   
You can convert between numeric types using:   
- int(): Converts to integer  
- float(): Converts to float  
- complex(): Converts to complex number  

**Example**  

# Integer  
num1 = 10  

# Float  
num2 = 10.5  

# Complex  
num3 = 2 + 3j  

# Type Conversion  
num4 = float(num1)  # Converts integer to float  

**Conclusion**  
Understanding numeric data types is essential for performing calculations and data manipulation in Python.
