# Data Types in Python  
    Python includes several built-in data types to store various kinds of data. These types determine the operations that can be performed on the data and how it is stored in memory.  

**Common Python Data Types:**  

**Numeric Types:**  

    **int (Integers):**   Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimal points (e.g., 5, -100, 0).  
    
    **float (Floating-point numbers):**   Numbers with a decimal point (e.g., 3.14, -0.5, 2.0).  
    
    **complex (Complex numbers):**    Numbers with a real and an imaginary part (e.g., 2 + 3j, 1.5 - 0.5j).  

**Sequence Types:**  
    
    **str (Strings):**   Sequences of characters, enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes (e.g., 'hello', "Python", """multi-line""").  
    
    **list (Lists):**  Ordered, mutable collections of items, enclosed in square brackets. Items can be of different data types (e.g., [1, 'apple', 3.14]).  
   
    **tuple (Tuples):**  Ordered, immutable collections of items, enclosed in parentheses. Similar to lists but cannot be modified after creation (e.g., (1, 'banana', True)).  
    
    **range:** Represents an immutable sequence of numbers, often used in loops.  

**Mapping Type:**  
    
    **dict (Dictionaries):** Unordered collections of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces. Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}).  

**Set Types:**  
    **set (Sets):** Unordered collections of unique, immutable items, enclosed in curly braces (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).  
    **frozenset:** An immutable version of a set.  

**Boolean Type:**  
    **bool (Booleans):** Represents truth values, either True or False.  

**None Type:**  
    **NoneType:** Represents the absence of a value, with a single value None.
